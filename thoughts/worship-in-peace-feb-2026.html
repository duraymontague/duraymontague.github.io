  <h1>America was predicated on worship in peace</h1>
  <p class="date">February 2, 2026</p>

  <p>The United States really was established (and in a very real sense, its entire political project was predicated on) the principle that people should be able to worship (or not worship) in peace, without government coercion or persecution.</p>

  <p>That is one of the deepest motivations behind the founding.</p>
